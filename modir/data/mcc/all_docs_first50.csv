2018.0,,"Background. The rapid adoption of smartphones and software applications (apps) has become prevalent worldwide, making these technologies nearly universally available. Low-cost mobile health (M-health) platforms are being rapidly adopted in both developed and emerging markets and have transformed the health care delivery landscape. Human factors optimization is critical to the safe and sustainable adoption of M-health solutions. The overall goal of engaging human factors requirements in the software app design process is to decrease patient safety risks while increasing usability and productivity for the end user. Methods. An extensive review of the literature was conducted using PubMed and Google search engines to identify best approaches to M-health software design based on human factors and user-centered design to optimize the usability, safety, and efficacy of M-health apps. Extracted data were used to create a health care app development algorithm. Results. A best practice algorithm for the design of mobile apps for global health care, based on the extracted data, was developed. The approach is based on an iterative 4-stage process that incorporates human factors and user-centered design processes. This process helps optimize the development of safe and effective mobile apps for use in global health care delivery and disease prevention. Conclusion. Mobile technologies designed for developing regions offer a potential solution to provide effective, low-cost health care. Applying human factors design principles to global health care app development helps ensure the delivery of safe and effective technologies tailored to the end-users requirements.",,1572864,,,,,,,0,,Human Factors-Based Mobile Application Design for Global Health,mobile health; M-health; application; apps; human factors; innovation; global health,['Surgery']
2018.0,,"Methanol-to-olefins (MTO) has received great attention, in which abundant renewable resources of biomass and biogas can be utilized as promising alternatives to crude oil in the production of light olefins. SAPO-34 is one of the most promising catalysts in MTO reaction, providing excellent selectivity toward ethylene and propylene. In this work, highly crystalline SAPO-34 catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios have been applied in MTO reaction to elucidate the effects of particle size and acidity on the ""hydrocarbon pool"" intermediate distribution, which remarkably influence their catalytic performance in the reaction. A smaller particle size of SAPO-34 catalyst (e.g., 120-360 mesh) can improve the catalyst lifetime, but nearly no effect on the product distribution. A suitable density of Bronsted acid sites (BAS) was found to effectively prolong the catalyst lifetime and enhance the total selectivity toward light olefins (ethylene and propylene). GC MS and NMR analysis demonstrates that the suitable BAS density on SAPO-34 can suppress hydrogen transfer reaction for the formation of paraffins and the formation of polycyclic aromatics. The suitable BAS density was found to promote the formation of active ""hydrocarbon pool"" species, such as polymethylbenzenes, at a very low aromatic/CH3 ratio compared to those having a much higher BAS density (>0.2), which can significantly boost the selectivities to olefins as desired products and improve the catalyst lifetime at 100% conversion of methanol. Therefore, this work provides a potential way for the development of suitable catalysts for MTO reaction with high olefin selectivity and improved lifetime.",,1572865,,,,,,,0,,Tuning Hydrocarbon Pool Intermediates by the Acidity of SAPO-34 Catalysts for Improving Methanol-to-Olefins Reaction,Methanol-to-olefin reaction; SAPO-34; Bronsted acidity; Reaction mechanism,"['Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology;', 'Engineering, Chemical']"
2018.0,,"Background: Community-based health insurance (CBHI) has evolved as an alternative health financing mechanism to out of pocket payments in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in areas where government or employer-based health insurance is minimal. This systematic review aimed to assess the barriers and facilitators to implementation, uptake and sustainability of CHBI schemes in LMICs. Methods: We searched six electronic databases and grey literature. We included both quantitative and qualitative studies written in English language and published after year 1992. Two reviewers worked in duplicate and independently to complete study selection, data abstraction, and assessment of methodological features. We synthesized the findings based on thematic analysis and categorized according to the ecological model into individual, interpersonal, community and systems levels. Results: Of 15,510 citations, 51 met the eligibility criteria. Individual factors included awareness and understanding of the concept of CBHI, trust in scheme and scheme managers, perceived service quality, and demographic characteristics, which influenced enrollment and sustainability. Interpersonal factors such as household dynamics, other family members enrolled in the scheme, and social solidarity influenced enrollment and renewal of membership. Community-level factors such as culture and community involvement in scheme development influenced enrollment and sustainability of scheme. Systems-level factors encompassed governance, financial and delivery arrangement. Government involvement, accountability of scheme management, and strong policymaker-implementer relation facilitated implementation and sustainability of scheme. Packages that covered outpatient and inpatient care and those tailored to community needs contributed to increased enrollment. Amount and timing of premium collection was reported to negatively influence enrollment while factors reported as threats to sustainability included facility bankruptcy, operating on small budgets, rising healthcare costs, small risk pool, irregular contributions, and overutilization of services. At the delivery level, accessibility of facilities, facility environment, and health personnel influenced enrollment, service utilization and dropout rates. Conclusion: There are a multitude of interrelated factors at the individual, interpersonal, community and systems levels that drive the implementation, uptake and sustainability of CBHI schemes. We discuss the implications of the findings at the policy and research level.",,1572866,,,,,,,0,,"Barriers and facilitators to implementation, uptake and sustainability of community-based health insurance schemes in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review",Community health insurance; Community-based health insurance scheme; Implementation; Barriers and facilitators; Universal health coverage; Low- and middle-income countries,"['Public, Environmental & Occupational Health']"
2018.0,,"Background: A recent meta-analysis and systematic review suggested that single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) had a higher procedure failure rate with more blood loss and that it required a longer surgical time than conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Herein, we introduce our experience with the needlescopic grasper-assisted and bendable retractor-assisted SILC technique and evaluate its safety and sustainability. Methods: The present retrospective cohort study included 407 Japanese patients who underwent needlescopic grasper-assisted and bendable retractor-assisted SILC between January 2012 and April 2017 at our institution. Results: In the present study, all patients successfully underwent needlescopic grasper-assisted and bendable retractor-assisted SILC without conversion to open surgery. Regarding surgical outcomes, mean surgical time was 58.2 +/- 23.2 minutes, and additional ports were required in 9 patients (2.2%). Postoperative morbidity developed in only 6 patients (1.4%). Conclusions: The surgical approaches defined herein were safe and sustainable with favorable surgical outcomes. Compared with conventional SILC, needlescopic grasper-assisted and bendable retractor-assisted SILC might become a mainstream procedure for minimally invasive surgery from the viewpoint of surgical difficulty.",,1572867,,,,,,,0,,Stabilization of Single-incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy by Needle Puncture and Bendable Retractor,laparoscopic cholecystectomy; single-incision; needlescopic surgery,['Surgery']
2018.0,,"Re-shaping infrastructure systems and social practices within urban contexts has been promoted as a critical way to address a range of contemporary economic, environmental and social challenges. Though there are many attempts to re-imagine more sustainable urban contexts the challenge remains how to achieve such change. In this context, urban experiments have emerged as a way to stage purposive infrastructure interventions and learn what works in practice. The paper integrates literatures on urban governance and urban socio-technical experiments to extend analytical understanding of urban experimentation. Through a case study of 'sustainable transport' experimentation in Greater Manchester, we argue that place-based priorities that inform action on sustainable urban futures are conditioned by non-place-based, particularly national, interests. Our paper makes two key contributions. First, we illustrate how the (narrow) national conditioning of place-based priorities translates in to experimentation in episodic ways that are highly contextual. We detail how national priorities, stipulations and funding are mediated and translated at the urban scale where they set conditions for the range of interventions that are feasible in a particular context. The interventions that follow are then materially embedded in place through experimentation with processes of governing and constituting capacity. Second, we argue that the learning generated through these processes of experimentation is only weakly communicated back to conditioning institutions. The result is that there is strong conditioning of experimentation but weak experimentation with conditions. The paper illustrates how the potential of experimentation is conditioned and thus it brings to the fore the need to understand experimentation politically.",,1572868,,,,,,,0,,Conditioning experimentation: The struggle for place-based discretion in shaping urban infrastructures,Conditions; experiments; governance; urban; transport,"['Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Public', 'Administration']"
2018.0,,"Preventing food wastage is a key element of sustainable resource management. But as food waste is still generated at high volumes, priority is placed on its proper management as a resource, maximising sustainability benefits. This study, by integrating a multi-criteria decision analysis with a sustainability assessment approach, develops a screening and decision support framework for comparing the sustainability performance of food waste management options. A structured process for selecting criteria based on the consideration of environmental, economic and social aspects related to region-specific food waste system planning, policy and management has been developed. Two food waste management options, namely the use of food waste disposal units, which grind food waste at the household's kitchen sink and discharge it to the sewer, and the anaerobic co-digestion of separately collected food waste with sewage sludge, were selected for comparison due to their potential to create synergies between local authorities, waste and water companies, with local circumstances determining which of the two options to adopt. A simplified process used for assessing and comparing the two food waste management options in the Anglian region in the UK, indicated that there are benefits in using the framework as a screening tool for identifying which option may be the most sustainable. To support decision-making, a detailed analysis that incorporates stakeholders' perspectives is required. An additional use of the framework can be in providing recommendations for optimising food waste management options in a specific region, maximising their sustainability performance.",,1572869,,,,,,,0,,A multi-criteria sustainability assessment framework: development and application in comparing two food waste management options using a UK region as a case study,Food waste; Food waste disposal units (FWDs); Anaerobic co-digestion; Sustainability assessment framework; Multi-criteria analysis; Decision-making,['Environmental Sciences']
2018.0,,"Many uncontrollable risks and uncertainties emerge during transitions pathways. Previous studies have examined the ""formula"" of successful sustainable initiatives (SIs), while there have been few attempts to explore the reciprocities amongst them. Therefore, this study is to investigate the linkages among and mutual benefits among SIs at different urban scales for tackling their risks and uncertainties. The low-carbon eco-city, green university and green building in China are selected as the representatives at city, community and building scales for elaborating their linkages. In the city-community-building system, the GB implementation builds up the internal momentum that can lead to the changes of sustainable interests, rules and beliefs at the community scale, which then results in the changes on city structures, according to the theory of multi-level perspective. Akin to living organisms, cities witness the energy and materials flowing across different urban scales. Resources during SI implementation at a specific level can be shared by SIs at other levels. Meanwhile, the output of an SI can be transferred as the input of SIs at other levels. The commonalities among assessment systems of LCEC, GU and GB can upscale or downscale the successful experiments across different scales, contributing to the overcome of political, financing and operating risks and certainties. This paper can inform people with understandings of the vertical integration of SIs for sustainability transitions on the one hand and can practically provide decision makers with an approach to overcoming the barriers in SI implementation on the other.",,1572870,,,,,,,0,,Promoting and implementing urban sustainability in China: An integration of sustainable initiatives at different urban scales,Sustainability transitions; Risks and uncertainties; Low-carbon eco-city; Green university; Green building; City-community-building system,"['Development Studies; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning;', 'Urban Studies']"
2018.0,,"Electrocatalytic reduction of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol on Pd supported on carbon felt was conducted in the aqueous phase using a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol was added to the electrolyte to study the impact of alcohol type and concentration on the rates of benzaldehyde electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) and H-2 evolution, which is the prevalent side reaction. Whereas the ECH rates and Faradaic efficiency decreased with increasing alcohol concentrations, H-2 evolution rates remained constant. The impact of the alcohol on hydrogenation was greater as the length of the alcohol's hydrocarbon chain increased. Increasing the benzaldehyde concentration allows for high ECH rates and high Faradaic efficiency. The reaction order increased from similar to 0.13 to similar to 0.66 with half-cell potential increasing from -650 to -1150 mV (vs Ag/AgCl). Kinetic analysis reveals that the changes in reaction order are due to changes in benzaldehyde (and H) surface coverages as a function of half-cell cathodic potential. Thus, the results shown here reveal how the performance of the continuous electrocatalytic operation is affected by the electrolyte composition and half-cell cathodic potential.",,1572871,,,,,,,0,,Kinetic Investigation of the Sustainable Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Benzaldehyde on Pd/C: Effect of Electrolyte Composition and Half-Cell Potentials,Electrocatalytic reduction; H-2 evolution; Flow electrocatalytic cells; Benzaldehyde reduction; Pd supported on carbon,"['Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology;', 'Engineering, Chemical']"

2018.0,,"Energy efficiency of systems stands out as a critical parameter to achieve sustainability. Heat transfer processes spend an important part of overall energy consumption, so the enhancement of its efficiency is an important research field. Nanofluids have received increasing attention to reach this goal because of its initial conception as thermal-improved working fluids. Nevertheless, the increase in thermal conductivity produced by the dispersion of nanoparticles should not be the only focus. In forced convection processes, viscosity plays an important role in achieving an improvement of the exchange of heat. In addition, the energy consumption needed to pump the new fluid is directly related to its viscosity. In this work, the rheological behaviour of different loaded functionalized graphene nanoplatelet dispersions (nanoparticle mass concentrations, wt%, of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0) in three based fluids (water, propylene glycol:water mixture at 30:70 wt% and propylene glycol:water mixture at 50:50 wt%) has been investigated by using a rotational rheometer. A double cone geometry was employed together with a cover specially appropriated to help thermostatization and avoid evaporation at high temperatures. The viscosity curves in the shear rate range from 10 to 1000 s(-1), with 10 points per decade, and in the temperature range from 283.15 to 353.15 K, with 10 K step, were determined for the three base fluids and the twelve different nanofluids. The dynamic viscosities values of the base fluids were compared with those available in the literature, absolute average deviations being lower than the experimental uncertainty. The dynamic viscosities of the nanofluids were obtained for the Newtonian ranges and their dependences with temperature and nanoadditive concentration were analysed, as well as the influence of the base fluid on these trends. Furthermore, the fitting parameters of an equation that models temperature and nanoparticle concentration dependences are provided, which allow to describe viscosity data for each of the three sets of nanofluids with deviations lower than 1.8%. Finally, linear viscoelastic oscillatory experiments were performed for those samples that showed evidences of Non-Newtonian behaviour in the non-linear tests. These oscillatory tests were carried out in the deformation range from 0.1 to 1000% at constant frequency, 1 Hz, and at 283.15 and 293.15 K. Unlike the base fluids and other nanofluids sets, the nanofluids of the analysed propylene glycol:water 50:50 nanofluid set at 283.15 K and 293.15 K present a clear shear thinning (pseudoplastic) non-Newtonian behaviour, the Newtonian plateaus being easily identified as the concentration rises in the lowest deformations range.",,1572873,,,,,,,0,,Rheological behaviour of functionalized graphene nanoplatelet nanofluids based on water and propylene glycol:water mixtures,Nanofluids; Rheological behaviour; Viscosity; Graphene nanoplatelets; Propylene glycol,['Thermodynamics; Mechanics']
2018.0,,"To exploit the use of hydrogen as a source of sustainable energy, development of an efficient process for synthesizing an energy carrier such as ammonia under mild conditions will be necessary. Here, we show that Ru/La0.5Pr0.5O1.75 prereduced at an extraordinary high temperature wof 650 degrees C catalyzes high NH3-synthesis rates under mild conditions. At 400 degrees C under 1.0 MPa, the synthesis rate was comparable with that of most active oxide-supported Ru catalysts. Kinetic analysis revealed that hydrogen poisoning, which is a typical drawback for oxide-supported Ru catalysts such as Cs+/Ru/MgO, was effectively suppressed over Ru/La0.5Pr0.5O1.75. The high activity induced by high-temperature reduction was attributable to the good thermal stability of the support and a phase change of the La0.5Pr0.5O1.75 support during prereduction. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy measurements after N-2 adsorption on the catalyst revealed that electrons lwere efficiently donated from trigonal La0.5Pr0.5O1.5 to the antibonding pi orbital of the N  N bond of N-2 via Ru atoms. Cleavage of the N  N bond, the rate-determining step for ammonia synthesis, was thus accelerated. Our results expand the range of possibilities for developing more effective ammonia synthesis catalysts under mild conditions. Such catalysts will be needed to enable development of hydrogen-based sustainable energy resources.",,1572874,,,,,,,0,,Ru/La0.5Pr0.5O1.75 Catalyst for Low-Temperature Ammonia Synthesis,NH3 synthesis; Energy carrier; Rare earth oxide; Ru catalyst; Phase change,"['Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology;', 'Engineering, Chemical']"
2018.0,,"Fructose is one of the most important aldoses and has been gaining attention as the starting material for the synthesis of biobased platform and high-added value chemicals such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), levulinic acid and lactic acid. However, due to its low natural occurrence, fructose is produced from glucose, an abundant hexose, via isomerization. Currently, the conventional industrial process utilizes glucose isomerase as a catalyst and is therefore subjected to the limitations of enzymatic reactions. Consequently, an alternative efficient solid catalyst is required that will exhibit high activity, selectivity and stability/reusability. Toward this end, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of using natural MgO, derived from simple calcination of magnesite ores, as a low cost catalyst with increased basicity. A series of industrial and laboratory prepared natural MgO materials with different morphology, porosity and basicity were investigated and the optimum catalyst afforded 44.1 wt % glucose conversion and 75.8 wt % fructose selectivity (33.4 wt % fructose yield), at 90 degrees C for a 45 min reaction in aqueous solution. The activity of the MgO catalysts was directly correlated with their basicity, which in turn depended on their crystal size, surface area and composition. CaO impurities of the natural MgO materials generated strong basic sites that enhanced glucose conversion but at the expense of fructose selectivity. The stability and reuse of the optimum catalyst was confirmed for at least 4 cycles of reaction regeneration, whereas the mechanism of glucose isomerization was validated via a first-order kinetic modeling set.",,1572875,,,,,,,0,,Isomerization of Glucose into Fructose over Natural and Synthetic MgO Catalysts,Glucose; Fructose; Isomerization; MgO; Basicity; Kinetic modeling study,"['Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; GREEN & SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY;', 'Engineering, Chemical']"
2018.0,,"There is a growing need for new techniques to synthesize metallic copper nanoparticles due to their remarkable use in many advanced technologies. Herein, a novel method to synthesize stable and nonagglomerated zero-valent copper nanoparticles (ZVCNPs) via the in situ formation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) during the electrospinning process in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone as a carbon source is presented. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques were used to investigate the morphology, structure, and composition of the fabricated materials. The synthesized ZVCNPs were coupled with TiO2 nanofibers and rGO to form an efficient photoactive material to photocatalytically produce hydrogen via water splitting, resulting in 344% increase in the hydrogen yield compared to that of TiO2 nanofibers. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the ZVCNPs enhance the charge transfer and lower the energy needed for photocatalytic water splitting.

2018.0,,"A novel flexible and free-standing electrospun Fe3+-PA/OTMS/PI nanofibrous membrane with superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity was successfully fabricated by electrospinning assembly in combination with surface modification technology. The as-prepared membrane exhibited excellent resistance to high temperature, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, corrosive liquids (such as acidic, basic, and salt solutions) and mechanical abrasion. In addition, the superhydrophobic and superoleophilic membrane could be efficiently used to separate various oil-water mixtures including dichloromethane (DCM), trichloromethane, dichloroethane, bromobenzene, and carbon tetrachloride. Furthermore, the as-prepared membrane still possesses a relatively stable and high flux level of 8424 +/- 105 L m(-2) h(-1) after repeated used for twenty separation cycles with the separation efficiency always above 99% and the oil content in the filtrate for all the tested oil-water mixture below 5 ppm.

2018.0,,"When fire rates are sufficiently high, fire disturbances can have negative impacts on industrial timber supplies. One can mitigate such problems at the strategic level by accounting for potential fire losses in the timber supply planning process by reducing harvest levels to maintain a buffer stock of timber. With a forest planning model based on a timber volume maximizing policy, reducing the harvest level will lead to a reduction in the harvested timber volume and likely, of revenues. One possible solution is to change the policy to increase the value of the wood that is harvested so as to minimize such reductions with less risk. We have evaluated alternative policies for three commercially-managed forests that have different burn rates in northeastern Canada. When compared with a volume-maximization policy, a revenue-maximization policy that considers sustained production and the sale of sawmilling wood products (lumber, chips and sawdust) increased mean revenues by 130% (36-770%) with > 0.90 probability and substantially decreased the area and volume harvested by 27% (11-38%) and 28% (14-36%), respectively. By reducing the harvest volume, the total number of jobs associated with forest operations decreased by 20% (10-27%) but the number of jobs per unit area harvested and volume increased. The policy also increased the harvest age and thereby enhanced the retention of a greater proportion of old-growth stands. Our study indicated that a tighter link between strategic planning and wood product processing helped identify better compromises between harvesting activities and revenues, despite the occurrence of natural disturbances.",,1572878,,,,,,,0,,A value-added forest management policy reduces the impact of fire on timber production in Canadian boreal forests,Boreal forest; Fire; Revenue; Risk analysis; Strategic supply planning,['Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry']
2018.0,,"Na-ion batteries are attractive as an alternative to Li-ion batteries because of their lower cost. Organic compounds have been considered as promising electrode materials due to their environmental friendliness and molecular diversity. Herein, aluminum-coordinated poly(tetrahydroxybenzoquinone) (P(THBQ-Al)), one of the coordination polymers, is introduced for the first time as a promising cathode for Na-ion batteries. P(THBQ-Al) is synthesized through a facile coordination reaction between benzoquinonedihydroxydiolate (C6O6H22-) and Al3+ as ligands and complex metal ions, respectively. Tetrahydroxybenzoquinone is environmentally sustainable, because it can be obtained from natural resources such as orange peels. Benzoquinonedihydroxydiolate also contributes to delivering high reversible capacity, because each benzoquinonedihydroxydiolate unit is capable of two electron reactions through the sodiation of its conjugated carbonyl groups. Electrochemically inactive Al3+ improves the structural stability of P(THBQ-Al) during cycling because of a lack of a change in its oxidation state. Moreover, P(THBQ-Al) is thermally stable and insoluble in nonaqueous electrolytes. These result in excellent electrochemical performance including a high reversible capacity of 113 mA h g(-1) and stable cycle performance with negligible capacity fading over 100 cycles. Moreover, the reaction mechanism of P(THBQ-Al) is clarified through ex situ XPS and IR analyses, in which the reversible sodiation of C=O into C-O-Na is observed.",,1572879,,,,,,,0,,Environmentally Sustainable Aluminum-Coordinated Poly(tetrahydroxybenzoquinone) as a Promising Cathode for Sodium Ion Batteries,coordination polymer; organic compound; benzoquinone; aluminum; sodium ion battery; cathode,"['Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary']"

2018.0,,"This work presents and discusses experimental results on the characterisation and metal leaching potential of a biogenic, metal-rich sulphidic sludge, generated in a sulphate-reducing bioreactor, operated to treat acidic synthetic solutions bearing Fe, Zn, Ni and Cu. The sustainability of the metal removal bioprocess strongly depends on the fate of the sludge. To propose appropriate management practices, a detailed characterisation of the sludge is necessary. The granulometry, chemical composition and mineralogy of the sludge were initially determined. The mobility of the metals was assessed via a modified Tessier experimental procedure. The leachability of the sludge metal content was determined via a standard compliance method (EN 12457-2) and experiments designed to evaluate the effect of pH and time on metal leaching from the sludge. The sludge metal content sums up to 69.5% dw, namely iron (14.8%), zinc (18.7%), nickel (17.7%) and copper (18.2%) and, based on the criteria set by European Union, the sludge is characterised as hazardous and inappropriate for landfilling without any pretreatment.

2018.0,,"This article examines infrastructure and technology assembled to support a malaria vaccine clinical trial, conducted between 2009 and 2014. It draws on ethnographic fieldwork at a medical research centre in north-eastern Tanzania, with additional data from interviews with researchers, vaccine scientists and trial funders. The infrastructure and technology were conceived of as enabling the development of a vaccine and facilitating future medical research and health care provision in Tanzania. However, after the clinical trial ended, these material remains were decaying, repurposed or lacked long-term sustainability without continued research funding. For trial staff in Tanzania, this led to expressions of affect, including disappointment, ambivalence and frustration as expectations for the future were foreclosed. The author argues that the material remains of the clinical trial had varied impacts and, furthermore, ambivalence is an embedded part of clinical trials due to their time constraints and lack of local rooting. The end of this clinical trial exposes the limitations of global health research in bringing about lasting change to low-resource settings.

2018.0,,"This paper firstly puts forward an analytical framework for the economic and environmental effects of regional land use transitions. Under the certain technical and institutional backgrounds, regional land use morphology changes adaptively with socio-economic development and turns out to be land use transitions at key time points. The transitions above may bring about positive economic effects as well as negative environmental effects. As the negative ones accumulate seriously and arouse public concern, the government will put forward relative management measures and policies to regulate land use activities and balance economic development with environmental protection. When a balance cannot be achieved within the current background, there will be a need to innovate the current technical or institutional conditions. Secondly, this paper takes Shandong province as a case study to conduct an empirical analysis with the latest econometric analysis methods and explores the effective mechanism among land use transitions, economic development, environmental emissions, and land use management according to current developing stages. The results show that urban construction land expansion is a pivotal factor for secondary industry development, as well as a potential factor for regional SO2 emissions, And the current urban land supply institution gets no significant causality with regional SO2 reduction, but significant with the secondary industry development. Finally, the authors argue that the phenomenon abovementioned is inevitable during the regional developing process. But taking future sustainable development strategies into account, the regional land use management need a transition from the demand-oriented ""passive"" management mode to the supply-oriented ""active"" management mode.

Herein, we report a simple strategy to design a cost-effective electrocatalyst comprising MnO2 nanorods on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and their composite with high surface area carbon by a chemical method. The optimized nanocomposite catalyst (MnBN/C-75) exhibits a substantial higher onset potential (E-onset = 0.9 V vs RHE) and limiting kinetic current density (J(L) = 5.6 mA cm(-2)) during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to other reported h-BN-based metal-supported or metal-free electrocatalysts. Moreover, this catalyst shows a similar to 4-electron transfer pathway with a low peroxide (HO2-) intermediate yield during electroreduction of oxygen, indicating a single step, first order kinetics as a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Besides, the mass activity of 222 mA mg(-1) calculated at 0.6 V for the MnBN/C-75 catalyst is similar to 21 times higher than that of MnBN (10.4 mA mg(-1)) and slightly lower than Pt/C (239 mA mg(-1) at 0.9 V). Importantly, the MnBN/C-75 nanocomposite reveals a smaller deviation in half-wave potential (Delta E-1/2 = 18 mV) compared to the Pt/C catalyst (Delta E-1/2 = 50 mV) even after 5k potential cycling under similar conditions. The relatively lower ionic diffusion and charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface by the MnBN/C-75 electrode support to our claim regarding a higher electrocatalytic activity. Thus, the presence of Mn3+ ions in the form of MnOOH (during composite formation) along with both h-BN support and KB carbon at the electrode surface contributes immensely in boosting the electrocatalytic activity. Thus, it could be a promising electrocatalyst, if employed in the cathode compartment of low-temperature fuel cells to lead faster ORR kinetics.",,1572885,,,,,,,0,,Hexagonal Boron Nitride-Supported Crystalline Manganese Oxide Nanorods/Carbon: A Tunable Nanocomposite Catalyst for Dioxygen Electroreduction,Hexagonal boron nitride; Manganese oxide; Ketjenblack carbon; Oxygen electroreduction; Fuel cell,"['Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; GREEN & SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY;', 'Engineering, Chemical']"
2018.0,,"As one of the major problems facing lithium ion batteries, sluggish charge transfer often induces undesirable large resistance, overpotential, and round trip inefficiency of batteries during recharge. The need to improve charge transport kinetics is motivating research into directions that would rely on high quality heterostructure designs, since it is reported that the synergistic effects and as-formed inbuilt electric fields of heterostructures could facilitate charge transport across the heterostructure, as well as enforce interactions between the active phases. Heteromanipulation holds great promise for realizing efficient interconnects between charge transport kinetics and heterostructure designs. However, most previous studies delineate ensemble measurements of a given static heteroelectrode, which do not permit isolating and dissecting the effects of heterostructural manipulation on electrochemical performances individually. Here, by choosing conversion type electrodes as an example and comparing series samples which were collected in the evolution of heterostructures, the effects of heterostructure manipulation toward modifying overpotential and lithium storage capability have been systematically investigated. The results demonstrate that structural features (e.g., robust skeleton, smaller grain sizes, and high quality hybridity) play an important role in engendering faster charge transfer and narrowing overpotential than that at the level of micrometer scales.",,1572886,,,,,,,0,,Heterostructure Manipulation toward Ameliorating Electrodes for Better Lithium Storage Capability,Overpotential; Heterostructure manipulation; Charge transfer kinetics; Hybridity; Lithium ion battery,"['Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology;', 'Engineering, Chemical']"
2018.0,,"Viola odorata L. (Violaceae), an Indian medicinal plant, contains a plethora of cyclotides, which are a class of cyclic peptides derived from plants, possessing several applications. Somatic embryo culture of V. odorata was developed, via indirect somatic embryogenesis, to serve as an alternative to natural plant biomass for sustainable and continuous production of its bioactive ingredients, such as cyclotides. Among the various combinations of phytohormones tested, Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 1 mg/l thidiazuron gave rise to the maximum frequency of induction (86.7%) and a high number of somatic embryos (3) from an embryogenic callus. Identification and characterization of cyclotides in the somatic embryos were carried out using a Fourier transform mass spectrometer coupled with liquid chromatography (LC-FTMS). Among the cyclotides identified in the study, few were found to be exclusively present in the somatic embryo culture. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the cyclotides was higher in somatic embryo extract than in the natural plant extract. The biological activities (cytotoxic, haemolytic and antimicrobial) of the somatic embryos and the parent plant were compared. Unlike the natural plants, the somatic embryo extracts demonstrated specificity Le. they were found to be potent against cancerous cells but not against non-cancerous cell line or red blood cells. In contrast to the plant extract, the somatic embryos extracts were found to be potent against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. These results suggest that somatic embryos of V. odorata (rich in cyclotides) can be used as an alternative to plant biomass for its therapeutic applications and germplasm conservation.",,1573105,,,,,,,0,,Production of bioactive cyclotides in somatic embryos of Viola odorata,Viola odorata L.; Violaceae; Somatic embryo; Cyclotides; Cytotoxic; Haemolytic; Antimicrobial,['Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences']
2017.0,"Esteves, VPP, Esteves, EMM, Bungenstab, DJ, Feijo, GLD, Araujo, ODF, Morgado, CDV","Economic uncertainties and environmental constraints regarding fossil fuels have encouraged initiatives for renewable energy sources and assessment of their life cycle impacts. Brazil ranks second worldwide in biodiesel production, despite the relatively recent organization of its national chain, marked by the creation of the National Program for Biodiesel Production and Use (PNPB). The Central-West region is responsible for the largest share of biodiesel production (44.4%) and the largest cattle slaughter (37.5%). In this scenario, beef tallow has great potential for expansion of biodiesel production, since it is a byproduct of the chain that, when not properly disposed, presents a considerable environmental burden. This work presents a method for assessing environmental performance that integrates life cycle assessment (LCA) with land use change (LUC) for analysis of the tallow biodiesel production chain. The results are given in terms of increment in annual greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions per hectare related to local tallow biodiesel. The system's boundary covers a representative major cattle farming area in Central-West Brazil. For the LCA segment of the method, five inventory allocations were considered: (i) without allocation, (ii) mass, (iii) market value, (iv) energy and (v) an ""average allocation"", calculated as the mean of mass, market value and energy. The last one is a novel approach proposed in this work, aggregating all the others, which separately result in under or over estimation of impacts. Using the ""average allocation"", the increment in annual GHG emission per hectare from tallow biodiesel production, is 43.2 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) y(-1). This value is 17% less than the emission increment due to soybean biodiesel (50.2 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) y(-1)). LUC is responsible for 96% of the emission assessed, which demonstrates the importance of including LUC assessment in life cycle assessment of tallow biodiesel. According to the sensitivity analyses performed, changes from crop to pasture have superior environmental performance among the investigated options. Land use management is essential to preserve the remaining natural areas, making tallow biodiesel more sustainable. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

2018.0,,"The concept of microsites for recruitment is central to plant ecology, but it is unclear whether these sites are abstract constructs or real entities. I hypothesize that, in generally microsite-limited communities, microsites comprise a limiting physical resource for which different species compete. I tested this hypothesis on winter-annual communities on biocrust in the semiarid Northern Negev of Israel, in which most species are microsite-limited, while the dominant grass (Stipa capensis) has overcome this limitation by efficient microsite acquisition and a lack of secondary seed dormancy. I tested whether the dominant suppresses the subordinate species, collectively, during recruitment, rather than during growth. To this end, I conducted a field experiment with three blocks of six plots (6 m x 6 m) with two treatments - mowing in spring 2006 (intershrub, intershrub + shrub patches, and none) and shrub-patch removal (0% or 50% of the patches). I collected data from four seed traps per plot before spring 2007 and from five plant samples per plot at the end of spring. Mowing significantly reduced both seed and plant density of the dominant species, reflecting seed-limited recruitment, and increased subordinate plant density by competitive release. Multiple regressions of per-plant and per-gram effects and responses showed that competition was a direct effect of the dominant's density. Total and per-group biomass was proportional to density, implying density-independent per capita growth. Subordinate species number also increased with their density, due to the sample-size effect. These findings indicate that the seed-limited dominant diffusely suppresses the subordinates during recruitment, supporting the microsite competition hypothesis. The shift from growth resources to microsites extends the role of inter-specific competition along productivity and disturbance gradients, and highlights the asymmetric relationship between the two kinds of competition, as microsite competition is only observable if initial abundances are not overshadowed by density-dependent growth and mortality. The findings also demonstrate that (1) lacking secondary seed dormancy is an evolutionarily stable strategy in dryland annuals, alongside seed dormancy in microsite-limited species, and (2) biomass removal (e.g., by herbivory) increases small-scale biodiversity, enhancing the sustainability of dryland grazing, but without compensatory growth.",,1573108,,,,,,,0,,Competition for microsites during recruitment in semiarid annual plant communities,annual plants; biocrust; cascading effects; density-independent growth; diffuse competition; microsite acquisition; microsite limitation; secondary seed dormancy; seed-limited recruitment; semiarid shrubland; Stipa capensis,['Ecology']

2018.0,,"BACKGROUND Increasing environmental and energy concerns are pushing the development of a bio-based economy, employing highly reproducible, sustainable and green biomanufacturing methods. Here a potential building block 5-aminovalerate for polymer synthesis has been produced from l-lysine. RESULTS l-lysine alpha-oxidase from Scomber japonicas was overexpressed in BL21(DE3); a lysine degradation gene was knocked out to strengthen this process in the microbe. The additions of ethanol and hydrogen peroxide significantly enhanced the production of 5-aminovalerate. The recombinant Escherichia coli CJ02 strain was cultured in a medium containing 20 g L-1 glucose, 10 g L-1 l-lysine, 4% (v/v) ethanol and 10 mM H2O2, producing 5.61 g L-1 5-aminovalerate with a yield of 0.56 g g(-1). Compared with the original producer, this titre represents an 18-fold increase. Excellently, 29.12 g L-1 5-aminovalerate could be achieved with a yield of 0.44 g g(-1) in a 5 L fermenter. CONCLUSION This biotechnological 5-aminovalerate production demonstrates a simple, economic, and green technology to replace the ubiquitous chemical synthesis. More importantly, this strategy of adding ethanol to increase protein expression is not only an efficient process for the production of 5-aminovalerate, but also might be used in the production of other high value-added chemicals.

Herein, we demonstrate the enhanced potential of aqueous solutions of self-buffering cholinium-based Good's buffers ionic liquids (GB-ILs), at 20 and 50% (w/w), as alternative preservation media of recombinant small RNAs. The thermal stability of RNA is highly enhanced by GB-ILs, with an increase of 14 degrees C in the biopolymer melting temperature-the highest increase observed to date with ILs. Most GB-ILs investigated improve the stability of RNA at least up to 30 days, both at 25 degrees C and at 4 degrees C, without requiring the typical samples freezing. Molecular dynamics simulations were applied to better understand the molecular-level mechanisms responsible for the observed RNA improved stability. The number of IL cations surrounding the RNA chain is similar, yet with differences found for the IL anions, which are responsible for the overall charge of the biopolymer first solvation sphere. No cytotoxicity of the studied solutions containing RNA and ILs at 20% (w/w) was observed onto two distinct human cell lines, reinforcing their potential to act as preservation media when foreseeing biopharmaceutical applications.

2018.0,,"Future sustainability of road transportation will require substantial improvement in the efficient use of energy by road vehicles. As new technologies being deployed reduce total vehicle energy consumption, the contribution of tyre rolling resistance to total energy consumption continues to increase. For this reason tyre rolling-resistance is starting to drive the focus of many tyre developments nowadays. This is because the rolling-resistance can be responsible for 20-30% of the total vehicle fuel consumption. Thus, lowering the rolling-resistance would help to reduce the fuel consumption (i.e. CO2, NOx and hydrocarbon emissions) and hence improve the environment greatly given the large number of vehicles used globally. It is found that the primary source of the rolling-resistance is the tyre deformational behaviour (i.e. hysteresis damping) which can account for 80-95% of the total rolling-resistance.

Standardized scales to assess maturity stages are a fundamental tool to understand the demographic composition of exploited populations. Staging scales for female Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, have been subject to a series of changes, and multiple inconsistent scales are in use in different fisheries regions. A unified, evidence-based scale has not previously been established. We reviewed previous staging scales for the female ovary maturation and propose a revised scale based on the correlation between macroscopic and microscopic ovary characteristics. To provide better-informed tools for future stock assessment, female stages were characterized through external observation on ovary color and size, and the progress of vitellogenesis. This study clarifies several biological phases that were conflated in previous scales. First, we demonstrate how to distinguish between immature ovaries in juvenile females versus the earliest ovary maturation stage in adults. Second, the new scale differentiates between ""mottled"" ovaries seen in two separate biological stages: the spent ovaries that undergo partial resorption in berried females, versus ovaries of females which failed to spawn and undergo full resorption. To ensure consistent application, colors are assessed relative to international standards (RAL/Pantone).

To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel, integrated process to fully utilize each component of GP for the production of oil, polyphenols, and biochemicals (acetone, butanol, and ethanol; ABE). GP was first subjected to pressurized liquid extraction to recover grape oil and polyphenols sequentially. The solid residue was pretreated with NaOH to partially dissolve lignin and was then hydrolyzed with enzymes to obtain reducing sugars. Finally, those reducing sugars were fermented to ABE by Clostridium beijerinckii. The key process conditions, including polyphenol extraction and pretreatment conditions, were optimized.

This not only wasted the organic substrate, but also decreased the catalytic efficiency of the metal catalysts. To solve this problem, we prepared a lignosulfonate/dicationic ionic liquid composite via ion exchange process. The thereby obtained materials can be used as catalyst supports for preparing heterogeneous Cu-based catalysts. The supports and the catalysts were characterized by many physicochemical methods including FT-IR, elemental analysis (EA), FSEM, FTEM, XPS, and TG. Interestingly, the catalyst can enrich the alkynol component in the reaction system, thus enabling Glaser heterocoupling reactions of alkynols and phenylacetylenes to proceed well with a low substrate ratio. The substrate scope of the Glaser heterocoupling reaction, enriching effect of the composite support for the alkynol component, and recyclability of the catalyst were also investigated.",,1573124,,,,,,,0,,"Lignosulfonate/Dicationic Ionic Liquid Composite as a Task-Specific Catalyst Support for Enabling Efficient Synthesis of Unsymmetrical 1,3-Diynes with A Low Substrate Ratio",Glaser hetero-coupling; Lignosulfonate; Heterogeneous catalyst; Biomass,"['Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology;', 'Engineering, Chemical']"
2018.0,,"To mitigate externalities of the urban transportation system, various travel demand management policies have been tested across the world in the past decades. Among them, vehicle restriction is considered the most straightforward way to reduce travel demands. The effects of this policy, however, are still inconclusive. Using the massive license plate recognition (LPR) data in Langfang, China, this study investigates the differences of two typical license-plate-number-based vehicle restriction strategies, i.e., One-Day-Per-Week (ODPW) and Odd-And-Even (OAE). This study compares ODPW and OAE from two perspectives: travel demand and traffic condition over the road network. In addition to the change of traffic volume, the analysis of travel demand also includes the investigations of ""illegal"" travel, which denotes the road use of restricted vehicles, and travel intensity, which represents the travel frequency of certain vehicles in a time period. The changes of traffic condition are assessed by travel speed. Findings confirm that traffic volume declines as ODPW shifts to OAE, but not as significantly as expected. This less-than-full adjustment can be explained by the increase of illegal travel and travel intensity. The policy shift from ODPW to OAE significantly improves the travel speed in most of the road segments, whether in peak hours or off-peak hours. The conclusions in this study provide in-depth insights into the influence of vehicle restriction policies and contribute to the effective design of travel demand management strategies.",,1573125,,,,,,,0,,"Effects of vehicle restriction policies: Analysis using license plate recognition data in Langfang, China",Vehicle restriction; Travel demand; Traffic condition; Traffic policy; Traffic sustainability,['Economics; Transportation; Transportation Science & Technology']
2018.0,,"Plants face different types of biotic and abiotic stresses during their life span. Heavy metal (HM) stress is considered as one of the most challenging and emerging threats to sustainable agricultural development and overall economic yield of various plant species. Increasing levels of HMs in arable soils is a main environmental issue due to their deleterious effects on plant growth and productivity. The exogenous application of different plant growth regulators is a well-known strategy to alleviate the adverse effects of HMs stress on plants. In the present review, the role of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in the alleviation of HM stress in different plants is elaborated. 5-Aminolevulinic acid is identified as a highly efficient ameliorating agent to sustainably neutralize the harmful effects of abiotic stresses in plants. In particular, the role of ALA has been increasingly recognized in improving plant HM stress-tolerance via ALA-mediated control of principal plant-metabolic processes. However, various underlying mechanisms that unravel ALA-induced plant HM stress-tolerance remain unexplored. The application of ALA on HM-stressed plants improves plant height, root length, chlorophyll pigments, antioxidant enzyme activities, nutrient uptake and soluble protein contents and minimizes ultra-structural damage, oxidative stress and HM uptake. Furthermore, it triggers modification of glutathione reductase, ascorbic acid and GSH contents in HM-stressed plants. The lower concentration of ALA proved to be more beneficial in stress amelioration. The cost-effectiveness and efficiency of ALA in improving growth and production of plants under varying growth conditions is still not clear. Nevertheless, over-accumulation of ALA through genetic manipulation can enhance stress-tolerance in plants which is the key area to be investigated. This review article elaborates the potential role of ALA in HM tolerance and highlights the future research dimensions in the related ambits.",,1573126,,,,,,,0,,5-Aminolevulinic Acid-Induced Heavy Metal Stress Tolerance and Underlying Mechanisms in Plants,5-Aminolevulinic acid; Heavy metal stress; Antioxidant enzymes; Nutrients uptake; Stress-tolerance mechanisms,['Plant Sciences']
2018.0,,"The project for an acoustic shell in the Italian city of Matera was looked as an opportunity to explore an alternative stereotomic approach. The semi-vaulted space was initially thought to be built with discrete blocks of stone following a structural system in compression bounded by tie-rods, but practical and economic sustainability issues led to a different approach to that of classic cutting and carving raw stone. The collaboration between two different research teams led to the incorporation of a reusable mold technology; with the help of robotic technology and flexible moulding, it became possible to create customized heavy blocks discarding the need for disposable one-off moulds for casting voussoirs. By surveying stereotomy as a classic discipline within the scope of this project, this paper extrapolates and reflects on the validation of a different production process facing the classic ones that have defined stereotomy in architecture and construction.",,1573127,,,,,,,0,,Variable Casting of Voussoirs for a Stereotomic Shell,Stereotomy; Structural systems; Computer technology; Automation; Digital fabrication,['Architecture; History & Philosophy Of Science']
2018.0,,"After the 2015 earthquake in Nepal that killed approximately 9,000 people, the country faced an increased risk of cholera outbreaks due to extensive destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure and massive displacement. The disaster revealed long-standing weaknesses in water and sanitation systems in the country. Anticipating a cholera outbreak in 2016, UNICEF, Johns Hopkins University, and the Group for Technical Assistance partnered to support the Government of Nepal to ensure a safe water supply and improve sanitation and hygiene. This article discusses challenges, gaps, lessons learned and recommendations that were drawn from the authors' experience in cholera prevention and control in post-earthquake Nepal. Challenges identified include lack of regular water quality testing and monitoring, inconsistent use of point-of-use water treatment products, and lack of a fast-track mechanism for rapid response. The article argues for building a resilient water and sanitation system to secure sustainable and equitable access to safe drinking water.",,1573123,,,,,,,0,,"Emergency response in water, sanitation and hygiene to control cholera in post-earthquake Nepal in 2016",cholera; diarrhea; disasters; disease outbreaks; sanitation,['Water Resources']

2018.0,,"Water splitting has been considered as one of the most prospective technologies for enhancing sustainable output of hydrogen and reducing the release of carbon dioxide in the 21st century. Much attention has been paid to designing optimal electrocatalysts for water splitting, which includes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To date, the most effective water splitting electrocatalysts are still Pt based and Ir or Ru group noble metal materials, which can significantly improve the current density with the presence of a low overpotential. As alternatives to noble metals electrocatalysts, a series of studies have been carried out for cobalt-based electrocatalysts on the strengths of non-noble metal properties over the past years. However, the defect engineering of cobalt-based materials for the water splitting process has not been explained systematically. Herein, we summarize various kinds of defects and their functions based on Co-based materials for OER and HER The principles of how various defects improved electrocatalytic performance are introduced clearly; then, the vacancies (included anion and cation vacancies) and heteroatomic doping (included nonmetal and metal atomic doping) were introduced systematically. Furthermore, we especially highlight several defect modification electrocatalysts. Finally, difficulties of defects engineering and the future research directions for Co-implicated electrocatalysts are proposed.",,1573130,,,,,,,0,,Defect Engineering of Cobalt-Based Materials for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting,Co-based materials; Defect; Vacancies; Doping; Water splitting,"['Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology;', 'Engineering, Chemical']"
